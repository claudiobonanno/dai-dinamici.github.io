##### 

**Title of the course:** "Introduction to Floer Homology"

**Lecturer:** Marco Mazzucchelli (CNRS & ENS Lyon)

**Syllabus:**

Lecture 1: Crash course in algebraic topology: singular homology and
cohomology, DeRham cohomology.

Lecture 2: The Morse homology theorem.

Lecture 3: Variational principle for Hamiltonian periodic orbits, action
spectrum, the Conley-Zehnder index.

Lecture 4: Construction of the Floer homology groups for aspherical
manifolds I.

Lecture 5: Construction of the Floer homology groups for aspherical
manifolds II, proof of the Arnold conjecture on the fixed points of
generic Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms.

Lecture 6: Bottâ€™s iteration formula for the Conley-Zehnder index, proof
of the Conley conjecture on the periodic points of generic Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms of aspherical manifolds. Bonus arguments: Floer homology
for monotone manifolds, products in Floer homology, spectral invariants,
symplectic homology, etc.
