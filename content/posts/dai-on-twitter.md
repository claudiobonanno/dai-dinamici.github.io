It is with great pleasure that I announce that the DinAmicI now have a
Twitter profile! [https://twitter.com/DinAmicI](https://twitter.com/DinAmicI)

For the moment the tweets will just be pointers to each new post on the
DAI website, with proper hashtagging for fast search. More elaborated
and/or fun uses may be envisaged for the future.

So follow the [@DinAmicI](https://twitter.com/DinAmicI)!
