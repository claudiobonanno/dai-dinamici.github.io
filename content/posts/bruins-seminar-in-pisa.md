"Sharp mixing rates via inducing with respect to general return times"

Abstract: For non-uniformly expanding maps inducing w.r.t. a general
(i.e., not necessarily first) return time to Gibbs Markov maps, we
provide sufficient conditions for obtaining sharp estimates for the
correlation function. This applies to both the finite and the infinite
measure setting. The results are illustrated by non-Markov intervals
maps with an indifferent fixed point. This is joint work with Dalia
Terhesiu.
