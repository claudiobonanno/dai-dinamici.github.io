"Ergodic Ramsey Theory: the Meeting point of Dynamics and Combinatorics"

Abstract: The goal of this talk is to demonstrate the dynamical
underpinning of some old and new results in combinatorics and number
theory. The results to be discussed include Schur's theorem on Fermat
equation over finite fields, theorems of van der Waerden and Szemeredi
on arithmetic progressions and some of modern developments involving
multiple recurrence along polynomials and applications to the patterns
in primes.
