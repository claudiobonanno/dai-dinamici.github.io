“Families of hyperbolic Hamiltonian tori”

Abstract:

In integrable Hamiltonian systems hyperbolic tori form families,
 parametrised by the actions conjugate to the toral angles. The  union
over such a family is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold.  Under
Diophantine conditions a hyperbolic torus persists a small  perturbation
away from integrability. Locally around such a torus  the normally
hyperbolic invariant manifold is the centre manifold  of that torus and
persists as well. We are interested in \`global’ persistence of the
normally hyperbolic  invariant manifold. An important aspect is how the
dynamics behaves  at the (topological) boundary. Where the manifold
extends to infinity  this boundary is empty – this case makes clear that
we need the  persistence theorem of normally hyperbolic invariant
manifolds in  the non-compact setting. If the normal hyperbolicity wanes
as the boundary is approached we  need to ensure that the perturbed
dynamics does not come closer  to the boundary. This provides the
necessary uniform lower bound  of normal hyperbolicity to still
ascertain persistence under small  perturbations. Making use of energy
preservation and of Diophantine  tori persisting by KAM theory this can
be achieved for families of  two-dimensional hyperbolic tori.
