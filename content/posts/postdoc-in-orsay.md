Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in Ergodic Theory
and Dynamical Systems within the project Non Uniform Hyperbolicity in
Global Dynamics of Sylvain Crovisier funded by the ERC.

**Beginning:** September 2018

**Length:** 24 months

**Location:** Laboratoire de Mathématiques d’Orsay, Université
Paris-Sud, France

**Research:** This postdoctoral position is funded by the ERC project
Non Uniform Hyperbolicity in Global Dynamics. This project studies the
qualitative, symbolic and probabilistic aspects of the dynamics of
differentiable dynamical systems (diffeomorphisms or flows). It focuses
in particular on: - partial hyperbolicity and various notions of
non-uniform hyperbolicity, - symbolic dynamics and ergodic theory of
differentiable systems, - perturbative techniques and genericity. The
research project of the candidate should be related to one of the main
tasks of this project.

**Teaching:** No teaching load

**Income:** The salary is about 2100 euros per month (net income)

**Application:** The candidate should sent an e-mail to Sylvain
Crovisier with subject \[Postdoc NUHGD\] YOUR\_NAME YOUR\_SURNAME by
10th December 2017. The email should include a CV (including a list of
publications), a short description of the research and a research plan.
Complete articles should not be attached to the email, but links to
Arxiv or a web page are very welcome. Recommendation letters should be
sent directly by the reference using an email with the same subject as
the candidate.

**Deadline:** 10th December 2017 at 24:00 (Paris-time).

**Contact:** <sylvain.crovisier@math.u-psud.fr>
