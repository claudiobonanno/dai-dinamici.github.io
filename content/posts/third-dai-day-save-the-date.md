Dear DinAmicI,

We're happy to announce that the next DAI DAY will take place on
**December 5, 2020** in Lecce.

It is a tremendous occasion for you to attend dynamical seminars and the
scientific assembly of the group, and to spend a weekend in a beautiful
city.

We hope to see you all in Lecce, but in the difficult times we all are
living, the event will also be streamed.

New information on the event will be posted by the organizers as soon as
possible.
