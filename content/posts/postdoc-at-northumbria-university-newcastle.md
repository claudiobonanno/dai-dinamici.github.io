A 12-month postdoctoral research position in Mathematics is now open
within the MCNP (Mathematics of Complex and Nonlinear Phenomena) group
in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering
Northumbria University Newcastle.    
  
**Please note: This position had been already advertised in July 2020,
but following a major IT incident it has not been possible to access
information about applications submitted for this post. Sincere
apologies to all applicants who will possibly read this email and whose
application happened to be not accessible. Those still interested are
strongly encouraged to re-apply.**

The research project is concerned with the development of an integrable
systems approach to the study of complex systems using methods of
nonlinear integrable partial differential equations and statistical
mechanics.

The ideal candidate will have expertise in mathematical modelling,
methods for partial differential equations and knowledge of statistical
mechanics and thermodynamics. Knowledge of integrable systems and random
matrix theory would also be beneficial.

This position is funded  by The Leverhulme Trust.

Applicants must hold a PhD in Mathematics or a relevant discipline by
the start of the project. The post is expected to start in February 2021
or as soon as possible thereafter. The application form is available
through the link:
