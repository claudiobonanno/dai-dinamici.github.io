If you'd like to post something on the website click on the "site admin"
link on the main page. You'll find it under "Meta links" on the left
hand side.  This will take you to your dashboard where you'll find a
"Posts" link on the top left. Click on the sub-link "Add New" and you'll
be brought to a page where you can create your post.  Note that you can
add links to webpages, such as
[www.DinAmicI.org](https://www.dinamici.org/) and media files such as
pictures:

by using the menu at the top.

IMPORTANT!!! Once you've finished writing your post don't forget to
choose at least one category from the categories menu on the right. Your
post will only appear on the website if it is categorised. Barring
exceptions, the category "News" should be checked for all posts,
together with possibly another category chosen among "Events", "Open
positions", "Forum".

For better indexing you can also add tags to your post.

You can preview your post using the preview option found at the
top-right of the page. Once finished click on the "Publish" button and
your post will be available to see on the website. Note that you can go
back and edit your post after it has been published.
