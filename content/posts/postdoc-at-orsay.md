Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in Ergodic Theory
and Dynamical Systems within the project Non Uniform Hyperbolicity in
Global Dynamics of Sylvain Crovisier funded by the ERC.

- Beginning: september 2019 - Length: 24 months - Location: Laboratoire
de Mathématiques d’Orsay, Université Paris-Sud 11, France - Teaching: no
teaching load - Income: the salary is about 2 100 euros per month

Research: this postdoctoral position is funded by the ERC project Non
Uniform Hyperbolicity in Global Dynamics. This project studies the
qualitative, symbolic and probabilistic aspects of the dynamics of
differentiable dynamical systems (diffeomorphisms or flows). It focuses
in particular to: \* partial hyperbolicity and various notions of
non-uniform hyperbolicity, \* symbolic dynamics and ergodic theory of
differentiable systems, \* perturbative techniques and genericity. The
research project of the candidate should be related to one of the main
tasks of this project.

Application: the candidate should sent an e-mail to Sylvain Crovisier
with subject \[Postdoc NUHGD\] YOUR\_NAME YOUR\_SURNAME by 10th December
2018. The email should include a CV (including a list of publications),
a short description of the research and a research plan. Complete
articles should not be attached to the email, but links to Arxiv or a
web page are very welcome. Recommendation letters should be sent
directly by the reference using an email with the same subject as the
candidate.

Deadline: 10th December 2018 at 24:00 (Paris-time).
