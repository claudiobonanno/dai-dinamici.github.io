**[2021 Chapel Hill Ergodic Theory Workshop: Global Online
Edition](https://ergwork.web.unc.edu/)**

The activities of the Virtual Ergodic Conference will take place in
three consecutive weeks, from June 21 to July 9, 2021. While schedules
are thought to adapt most time zones, these are specially fitted to
North & South America (week 1), Europe & Africa (week 2) and Asia &
Australia (week 3). The format will try to preserve the atmosphere of
the Chapel Hill Ergodic Theory Workshops with some adaptations to match
current virtual modalities.
