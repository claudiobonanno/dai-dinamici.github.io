When: Wednesday July 22, 2015, at 11:30

Where: Seminario I, Dept. of Mathematics, Università di Bologna

Who: Francesco Cellarosi (Queen's University, Canada)

What: Seminar "Recent progress towards Sarnak’s and Chowla’s
Conjectures"

Abstract: I will present an overview of Sarnak’s conjecture on the
disjointness of the Möbius function from any deterministic sequence and
the related Chowla’s conjecture on the self-correlations of the Möbius
function. Some progress towards weaker versions of these conjectures
have been made recently, and I plan<span class="truncate_more"> to
illustrate them</span>.
