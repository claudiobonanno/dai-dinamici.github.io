The [Italian National Institute for Advanced Mathematics
(INdAM)](http://www.altamatematica.it/) calls for 6 Research Projects to
be submitted by "Young Researchers".

The goal of the initiative is to foster the rise of new leaders in
mathematical research, who will be able to compete for ERC Starting
Grants and similar Research Funding Schemes.

The selected projects will have the duration of 1 year with no
possibility of renewal and will be given funds for a postdoctoral
position, which might be filled by the applicant him/herself. Each
proposal must indicate an institution of reference, among [those
recognized by INdAM](http://www.altamatematica.it/it/node/43).

Deadline: May 11, 2017
