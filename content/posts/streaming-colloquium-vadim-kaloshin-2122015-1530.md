We announce that the COLLOQUIUM at the Department of Mathematics,
University of Roma Tor Vergata, by Prof. Vadim Kaloshin, University of
Maryland (USA), will be available on Wednesday, December 2, at 15:30,
live on streaming at

The title of the talk is:

"Stochastic Arnold diffusion in deterministic systems and celestial
mechanics".

This will be our first attempt to make colloquia on streaming; we
apologize in advance for any unforeseen problem.

Below is the abstract of the talk.

Abstract: In 1964, V. Arnold constructed an example of a nearly
integrable deterministic system exhibiting instabilities. In the 1970s,
physicist B. Chirikov coined the term for this phenomenon Arnold
diffusion where diffusion refers to stochastic nature of instability.
One of the most famous examples of stochastic instabilities for nearly
integrable systems is dynamics of Asteroids in Kirkwood gaps in the
Asteroid belt. They were discovered numerically by astronomer J. Wisdom.
 During the talk we describe a class of nearly integrable
deterministic systems, where we prove stochastic diffusive
behaviour. Namely, we show that distributions given by deterministic
evolution of certain random initial conditions weakly converge to a
diffusion process. This result is conceptually different from known
mathematical results, where existence of iffusing orbitss shown. This
work is based on joint papers with O. Castejon, M. Guardia, J. Zhang,
and K. Zhang.
