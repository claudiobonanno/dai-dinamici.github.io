Mini-course on Double Resonances on December 12-16, 2016 Jean-Pierre
Marco and Vadim Kaloshin will give a mini-course on

Double resonances in the problem of Arnold diffusion

during the week of December 12-16, 2016, in Institut Henri Poincar√©
(lecture room 201) in Paris. They will address such issues as normal
forms along double resonances, singular cylinders, genericity, invariant
sets, and local transitivity. The goal is to explain some of the
technical details to the audience and to confront their viewpoints.
