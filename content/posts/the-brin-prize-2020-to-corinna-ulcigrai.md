The ninth Brin Prize in Dynamical Systems has been awarded to our own

**Corinna Ulcigrai** (University of Zurich)

for her fundamental work on the ergodic theory of locally Hamiltonian
flows on surfaces, of translation flows on periodic surfaces and
wind-tree models, and her seminal work on higher genus generalizations
of Markov and Lagrange spectra.

You can find the list of Corinna's prize papers
at <https://math.psu.edu/dynsys/Brinprize> or  <https://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-conference.html>

The award ceremony was planned for 18/04/2020 as part of the 2020
Maryland Spring dynamical systems conference, which has been canceled.
It is now planned for  April 10, 2021 (as part of 2021 Maryland
conference).
