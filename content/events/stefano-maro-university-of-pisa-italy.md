*Title: **Chaotic motion in the breathing circle billiard***

*Abstract:* We consider the free motion of a point particle inside a
circular billiard with periodically moving boundary, with the assumption
that the collisions of the particle with the boundary are elastic so
that the energy of the particle is not preserved. It is known that if
the motion of the boundary is regular enough then the energy is bounded
due to the existence of invariant curves. We show that it is
nevertheless possible that the motion of the particle is chaotic, also
under regularity assumptions for the moving boundary. More precisely, we
show that there exists a class of functions describing the motion of the
boundary for which the billiard map admits invariant probability
measures with positive metric entropy. The proof relies on variational
techniques based on Aubry-Mather theory. Joint work with Claudio
Bonanno.
