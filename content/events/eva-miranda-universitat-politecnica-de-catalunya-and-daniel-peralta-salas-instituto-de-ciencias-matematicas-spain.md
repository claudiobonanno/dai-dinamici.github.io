*Title: **Looking at Euler flows through a contact mirror: Universality
and Turing completeness***

*Abstract:* The dynamics of an inviscid and incompressible fluid flow on
a Riemannian manifold is governed by the Euler equations. Recently, Tao
launched a programme to address the global existence problem for the
Euler and Navier Stokes equations based on the concept of universality.
Inspired by this proposal, we show that the stationary Euler equations
exhibit several universality features, In the sense that, any
non-autonomous flow on a compact manifold can be extended to a smooth
stationary solution of the Euler equations on some Riemannian manifold
of possibly higher dimension. These results can be viewed as lending
support to the intuition that solutions to the Euler equations can be
extremely complicated in nature. A key point in the proof is looking at
the h-principle in contact geometry through a contact mirror, unveiled
by Sullivan, Etnyre and Ghrist more than two decades ago. We end up this
talk addressing an apparently different question: What kind of physics
might be non-computational? Using the former universality result, we can
establish the Turing completeness of the steady Euler flows, i.e., there
exist solutions that encode a universal Turing machine and, in
particular, these solutions have undecidable trajectories. But, in view
of the increase of dimension yielded by our proof, the question is: can
this be done in dimension 3? We will prove the existence of Turing
complete fluid flows on a 3-dimensional geometric domain. Our novel
strategy uses the computational power of symbolic dynamics and the
contact mirror again.  
This talk is based on joint work with Robert Cardona and Fran Presas
([arXiv:1911.01963](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01963) and
[arXiv:2012.12828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12828)).
