*Title: **Piecewise affine homeomorphisms of the circle and dilation
surfaces***

*Abstract: *In this talk I will consider the following question: if one
picks a piecewise affine map of the circle "at random”, what dynamical
behaviour are we likely to observe? The case of standard circle
diffeomorphisms has been studied by Herman in the 80s; in this
emblematic case the problem can be reduced to theorems close to KAM
theory. For the piecewise affine case, we put forward a geometric
approach, inspired by methods from both Teichmüller theory and
hyperbolic geometry.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
