*Title: **Hyperbolic motion in the Newtonian N-body problem with
arbitrary limit shape***

*Abstract: *We prove for the N-body problem the existence of hyperbolic
motions for any prescribed limit shape and any given initial
configuration of the bodies. The energy level h&gt;0 of the motion can
also be chosen arbitrarily. Our approach is based on the construction of
a global viscosity solutions for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
H(x,du(x))=h. Our hyperbolic motion is in fact a calibrating curve of
the viscosity solution. The presented results can also be viewed as a
new application of Marchal's theorem, whose main use in recent
literature has been to prove the existence of periodic orbits. Joint
work with Ezequiel Maderna.
