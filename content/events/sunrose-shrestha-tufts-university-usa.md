*Title: **The topology and geometry of random square-tiled surfaces***

*Abstract:* A square-tiled surface (STS) is a branched cover of the
standard square torus with branching over exactly one point. They are
concrete examples of translation surfaces which are an important class
of singular flat metrics on 2-manifolds with applications in Teichmüller
theory and polygonal billiards. In this talk we will consider a
randomizing model for STSs based on permutation pairs and use it to
compute the genus distribution. We also study holonomy vectors
(Euclidean displacement vectors between cone points) on a random STS.
Holonomy vectors of translation surfaces provide coordinates on the
space of translation surfaces and their enumeration up to a fixed length
has been studied by various authors such as Eskin and Masur. In this
talk, we obtain finer information about the set of holonomy vectors,
Hol(S), of a random STS. In particular, we will see how often Hol(S)
contains the set of primitive integer vectors and find how often these
sets are exactly equal.
