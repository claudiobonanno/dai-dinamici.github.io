*Title:* ***Rational Horocycle lifts and the tails of Quadratic Weyl
sums***

*Abstract:* Equidistribution of horocycles on hyperbolic surfaces has
been used to dynamically answer several probabilistic questions about
number-theoretical objects. In this talk we focus on horocycle lifts,
i.e. curves on higher-dimensional manifolds whose projection to the
hyperbolic surface is a classical horocycle, and their behaviour under
the action of the geodesic flow. It is known that when such horocycle
lifts are \`generic’, then their push forward via the geodesic flow
becomes equidistributed in the ambient manifold. We consider certain
‘non-generic’ (i.e. rational) horocycle lifts, in which case the
equidistribution takes place on a sub-manifold. We then use this fact to
study the tail distribution of quadratic Weyl sums when one of their
arguments is random and the other is rational. In this case we obtain
random variables with heavy tails, all of which only possess moments of
order less than 4. Depending on the rational argument, we establish the
exact tail decay, which can be described with the help of the Dedekind
\\psi-function.
