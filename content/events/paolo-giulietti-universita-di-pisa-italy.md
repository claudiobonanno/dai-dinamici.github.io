*Speaker:* **Paolo Giulietti**  (Università di Pisa, Italy)

*Title: **Infinite mixing for accessible skew products***

*Abstract: *I will present some decay of correlations results on skew
products which are locally accessible. The results rely on the study of
a twisted transfer operator and could be generalized to many other
situations. I will also present numerical counterparts to such results.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNNg155G3iLS7l-qZjboyg) then
saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you
agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.*
