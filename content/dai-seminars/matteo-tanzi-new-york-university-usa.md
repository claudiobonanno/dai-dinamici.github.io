*Title:* ***Random-like properties of chaotic forcing***

*Abstract:* We prove that skew systems with a sufficiently expanding
base have "approximate" statistical properties similar to random ergodic
Markov chains. For example, they exhibit approximate exponential decay
of correlations, meaning that the exponential rate is observed modulo a
controlled error. The fiber maps are only assumed to be Lipschitz
regular and to depend on the base in a way that guarantees diffusive
behaviour on the vertical component. The assumptions do not imply an
hyperbolic picture and one cannot rely on the spectral properties of the
transfer operators involved. The approximate nature of the result is the
inevitable price one pays for having so mild assumptions on the dynamics
on the vertical component. The error in the approximation is shown to go
to zero when the expansion of the base tends to infinity.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNNg155G3iLS7l-qZjboyg) then
saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you
agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.*
