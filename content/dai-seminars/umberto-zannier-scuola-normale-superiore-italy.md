*Title:* ***Torsion values of sections, elliptical billiards and
diophantine problems in dynamics***

*Abstract:* After a very brief review of basics on elliptic curves and
their families, we shall consider "sections" of such  families, and
especially their "torsion values".  For instance, what can be said of
the complex numbers b for which \[latex\](2, \\sqrt{2(2-b)})\[/latex\]
is torsion on the Legendre curve \[latex\]y^2=x(x-1)(x-b)\[/latex\]? In
particular, we shall recall results of "Manin-Mumford type" and focus to
illustrate some applications to elliptical billiards. Finally, if time
allows we shall frame these issues as special cases of a general
question in arithmetic dynamics, which can be treated with different
methods, depending on the context.  
(Most results refer to work with Pietro Corvaja and David Masser.)
