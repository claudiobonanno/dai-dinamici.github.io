*Title: **<span class="im">Invariance by induction of the asymptotic
variance</span>***

*Abstract:* It is well known that the integral of an observable is
preserved by induction. We are interested here in extensions of this
result to moments of order 2 and 3. We have two natural candidates for
the second and third order moments: the classical asymptotic variance
(given by the Green-Kubo formula) and an analogous quantity of the third
order. This question arises from the proof of CLT. In some cases, the
asymptotic variance in the CLT can be expressed on the one hand in terms
of the classical Green-Kubo formula and on the other hand in terms of
the Green-Kubo formula for the induced system. Under general assumptions
(involving transfer operators), we prove that the asymptotic variance is
preserved by induction and that the natural third order quantity is
preserved up to an error term. This is joint work with Damien Thomine.
