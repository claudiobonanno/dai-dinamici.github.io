*Title:* ***Central limit theorems for counting measures in coarse
negative curvature***

*Abstract:* We establish general central limit theorems for an action of
a group on a hyperbolic space with respect to counting for the word
length in the group.

In 2013, Chas, Li, and Maskit produced numerical experiments on random
closed geodesics on a hyperbolic pair of pants. Namely, they drew
uniformly at random conjugacy classes of a given word length, and
considered the hyperbolic length of the corresponding closed geodesic on
the pair of pants. Their experiments lead to the conjecture that the
length of these closed geodesics satisfies a central limit theorem, and
we proved this conjecture in 2018.

In our new work, we remove the assumptions of properness and smoothness
of the space, or cocompactness of the action, thus proving a general
central limit theorem for group actions on hyperbolic spaces.

We will see how our techniques replace the classical thermodynamic
formalism and allow us to provide new applications, including to lengths
of geodesics in geometrically finite manifolds and to intersection
numbers with submanifolds.
