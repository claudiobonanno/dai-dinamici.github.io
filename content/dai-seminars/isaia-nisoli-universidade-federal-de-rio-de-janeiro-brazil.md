*Speaker:* **Isaia Nisoli**  (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil)

*Title:* ***A simple system presenting Noise Induced Order***

*Abstract:* In this talk I will present a family of one dimensional
systems with random additive noise such that, as the noise size
increases, the Lyapunov exponent of the stationary measure transitions
from positive to negative. This phenomena is known in literature as
Noise Induced Order, and was first observed in a model of the
Belosouv-Zhabotinsky reaction and its existence was proven only recently
by Galatolo-Monge-Nisoli. In the talk I will show how this phenomena is
strictly connected with non-uniform hyperbolicity and the coexistence of
regions of expansion and contraction in phase space; the result is
attained through a result on the continuity of the Lyapunov exponent of
the stationary measure with respect to the size of the noise.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNNg155G3iLS7l-qZjboyg) then
saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you
agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.*
