*Title: **Infinite entropy for transcendental entire functions***

*Abstract: * Defining entropy on noncompact metric spaces is a tricky
business, since there are several natural and nonequivalent
generalizations of the usual notions of entropy for continuous maps on
compact spaces. By defining entropy for transcendental maps on the
complex plane as the sup over the entropy restricted to compact forward
invariant subsets, we prove that with this definition the entropy of
such functions is infinite. The proof relies on covering results which
are distinctive to holomorphic maps.
