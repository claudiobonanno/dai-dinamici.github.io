*Speaker:* **Gary Froyland** (University of New South Wales, Australia)

*Title: **The dynamic ocean***

*Abstract:* The circulation of our oceans strongly influences climate,
weather and biology. Our ocean currents are dynamic, and fluctuate to
varying extents. I will introduce data-driven numerical tools that can
tease apart dynamic components of the ocean, with information sourced
from ocean drifters, satellite imagery, and ocean models. These
components, their lifecycles, and their response to external forcing,
help us to build a dynamic picture of our ocean.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNNg155G3iLS7l-qZjboyg) then
saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you
agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.*
