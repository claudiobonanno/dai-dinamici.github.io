*Title:* ***Billiards in subriemannian geometry***

*Abstract:* When one considers manifolds with boundary, billiard
dynamics are the natural analogue of standard geodesic dynamics. Namely,
instead of having geodesics escape at the boundary, we force them back
into the manifold using the reflection law. In other dynamical settings,
similar constructions are possible: In 2006, B. Khesin and S.
Tabachnikov initiated the study of billiards in the semiriemannian
setting, studying the integrability of various tables. In recent years
we have also seen the appearance of several billiard setups of
symplectic nature. In this talk I will discuss recent work with L.
Dahinden in which we look at billiards in subriemannian geometry. I will
sketch how the reflection law arises naturally both from the
control-theoretical and symplectic perspectives, how the reflection is
problematic at tangency points between the distribution and the boundary
of the table, and I will introduce some concrete examples. My ultimate
goal will be to pose several intriguing open questions.
