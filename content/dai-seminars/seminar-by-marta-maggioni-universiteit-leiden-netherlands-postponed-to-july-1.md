The DinAmicI, in solidarity with the \#Strike4BlackLives and
\#ShutDownSTEM movements on June 10, 2020, acknowledge the racism
present throughout academia and especially in STEM subjects. In
agreement with our speaker Marta Maggioni, whom we sincerely thank, we
have decided to reschedule her talk to July 1st. We apologize for any
inconvenience and invite everybody to reflect and take action on
systemic inequalities in academia and science.
