*Speaker:* **Selim Ghazouani** (Université d’Orsay, France)

*Title:* ***Piecewise affine homeomorphisms of the circle and dilation
surfaces***

*Abstract:* In this talk I will consider the following question: if one
picks a piecewise affine map of the circle "at random”, what dynamical
behaviour are we likely to observe? The case of standard circle
diffeomorphisms has been studied by Herman in the 80s; in this
emblematic case the problem can be reduced to theorems close to KAM
theory. For the piecewise affine case, we put forward a geometric
approach, inspired by methods from both Teichmüller theory and
hyperbolic geometry.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNNg155G3iLS7l-qZjboyg) then
saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you
agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.*
