The past and future of scattering particle systems is partly determined

That this exists for bounded interactions and all initial conditions, is
part of a statement sometimes called 'asymptotic completeness'. The same
statement does not apply to individual initial conditions in celestial
mechanics. However, at least for up to four particles, nonexistence of
asymptotic velocity is a measure zero phenomenon. We explain some new
ideas connected with the proof (Poincaré section techniques for
wandering sets, non-deterministic particle systems, and walks on a poset
