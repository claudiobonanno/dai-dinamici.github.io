*Title: **Locating Ruelle-Pollicott resonances***

*Abstract:* We study the spectrum of transfer operators associated to
various dynamical systems. Our aim is to obtain precise information on
discrete spectrum. To this end we propose a unitary approach. We
consider various settings where new information can be obtained
following different branches along the proposed path. These settings
include affine expanding Markov maps, uniformly expanding Markov maps,
non-uniformly expanding maps, hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. We believe
this to be the germ of a general theory. Joint work with O. Butterley
and N. Kiamari.
