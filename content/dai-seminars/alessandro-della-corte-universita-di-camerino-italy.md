*Title:* ***The simplest erasing substitution***

*Abstract:* The symbolic action of a substitution on the binary
expansion generates naturally an interval map. In case of erasing
substitutions, the map is typically Baire-1 and not Darboux. As a model
case, we consider what is arguably the simplest erasing substitution,
mapping 0s to the empty word and 1s to 0 or 1 depending on the parity.
The corresponding interval map is shown to have fractal properties
(bounds are given on the Hausdorff dimension of the fibers) and to
display rich dynamical behavior, including Devaney chaos, uniform
distributional chaos of type 1, infinite topological entropy as well as
the presence of cycles attracting in a finite time every rational.

**NOTE:** *The seminar will be streamed live on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNNg155G3iLS7l-qZjboyg) then
saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you
agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.*
