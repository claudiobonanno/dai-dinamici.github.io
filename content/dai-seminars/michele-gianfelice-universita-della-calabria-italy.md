*Title: **Stochastic stability of classical Lorenz flow under impulsive
type forcing***

*Abstract: *Inspired by the problem of modeling the so called
anthropogenic forcing in climatology, e.g. the effects of the emissions
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we introduce a novel type of
random perturbation for the classical Lorenz flow and prove its
stochastic stability. The perturbation acts on the system in an
impulsive way, hence is not of diffusive type. Namely, given a
cross-section M for the unperturbed flow, each time the trajectory of
the system crosses M the phase velocity field is changed with a new one
sampled at random from a suitable neighborhood of the unperturbed one.
The resulting random evolution is therefore described by a piecewise
deterministic Markov process. The proof of the stochastic stability for
the unperturbed flow is then carried on working either in the framework
of the Random Dynamical Systems or in that of semi-Markov processes.
Joint work with Sandro Vaienti.
