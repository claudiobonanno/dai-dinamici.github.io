SUMMARY:Sunrose Shrestha  (Tufts University, USA)
DESCRIPTION:<p><em>Speaker:</em> <strong>Sunrose Shrestha</strong>  (Tufts University, USA)</p>
<p><em>Title:</em> <em><strong>The topology and geometry of random square-tiled surfaces</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> A square-tiled surface (STS) is a branched cover of the
standard square torus with branching over exactly one point. They are
concrete examples of translation surfaces which are an important class
of singular flat metrics on 2-manifolds with applications in Teichmüller
theory and polygonal billiards. In this talk we will consider a
randomizing model for STSs based on permutation pairs and use it to
compute the genus distribution. We also study holonomy vectors
(Euclidean displacement vectors between cone points) on a random STS.
Holonomy vectors of translation surfaces provide coordinates on the
space of translation surfaces and their enumeration up to a fixed length
has been studied by various authors such as Eskin and Masur. In this
talk, we obtain finer information about the set of holonomy vectors,
Hol(S), of a random STS. In particular, we will see how often Hol(S)
contains the set of primitive integer vectors and find how often these
sets are exactly equal.</p>
