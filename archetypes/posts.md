(for a new line without breaking a paragraph simply end the line with two or more spaces)

The following shortcodes for videos or images are available: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/

    {{< center >}}To center text, use the center shortcode{{< /center >}}

For images, I recommend to use:

    ![alt text here]({{< resource url="path inside the static folder" >}})

see may-12-online-event-celebrating-women-in-math-9-june-2020-1500.md for an example.


We can create more if needed, just let me know.

You cannot add html content, if you need that, I can make it possible, so, in case, let me know.
