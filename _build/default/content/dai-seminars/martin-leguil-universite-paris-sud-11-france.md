*Title: **Some rigidity results for billiards and hyperbolic flows ***

*Abstract:* In a project with P. Bálint, J. De Simoi and V. Kaloshin, we
have been studying the inverse problem for a class of open dispersing
billiards obtained by removing from the plane a finite number of smooth
strictly convex scatterers satisfying a non-eclipse condition. The
dynamics of such billiards is hyperbolic (Axiom A), and there is a
natural labeling of periodic orbits. We show that it is generically
possible, in the analytic category and for billiard tables with two
(partial) axial symmetries, to determine completely the geometry of
those billiards from the purely dynamical data encoded in their Marked
Length Spectrum (lengths of periodic orbits + marking). An important
step is the obtention of asymptotic estimates for the Lyapunov exponents
of certain periodic points accumulating a reference periodic point,
which turn out to be useful in the study of other rigidity problems. In
particular, I will explain the results obtained in a joint work with J.
De Simoi, K. Vinhage and Y. Yang on the question of entropy rigidity for
3-dimensional Anosov flows and dispersing billiards.
