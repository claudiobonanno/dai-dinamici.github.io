*Title: **Almost sure asymptotic behaviour of Birkhoff sums for infinite
measure-preserving dynamical systems***

*Abstract:* We are interested in the limit behaviour of Birkhoff sums
over an infinite sigma-finite measure space. If the observable is
integrable then -- by a classical theorem by Aaronson -- there exists no
sequence of real numbers such that the Birkhoff sum normed by this
sequence converges almost surely to 1. Under strong mixing conditions on
the underlying system we prove a generalized strong law of large numbers
for integrable observables using a truncated sum adding a suitable
number of terms depending on the point of evaluation. For f not
integrable we give conditions on f such that the Birkhoff sum normed by
a sequence of real numbers converges almost surely to 1. Joint work with
Claudio Bonanno.
