*Title: **Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture for centrally-symmetric
billiards***

*Abstract:* In this talk I shall discuss Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture
for centrally-symmetric C^2-smooth convex planar billiards. We assume
that the domain A between the invariant curve of 4-periodic orbits and
the boundary of the phase cylinder is foliated by C^0-invariant curves.
Under this assumption we prove that the billiard curve is an ellipse.
Other versions of Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture follow from this result.
For the original Birkhoff-Poritsky formulation we show that if a
neighborhood of the boundary of billiard domain has a C^1-smooth
foliation by convex caustics of rotation numbers in the interval (0;
1/4\] then the boundary curve is an ellipse. The main ingredients of the
proof are: (1) the non-standard generating function for convex
billiards; (2) the remarkable structure of the invariant curve
consisting of 4-periodic orbits; and (3) the integral-geometry approach
initiated by the author for rigidity results of circular billiards.
Surprisingly, we establish a Hopf-type rigidity for billiards in the
ellipse. Based on joint work with Andrey E. Mironov (Novosibirsk).
