**Postdoc position**

The Department of Mathematics at Heidelberg University invites
applications for one or more postdoctoral positions in mathematics
within the newly founded Research Station Geometry and Dynamics at the
Mathematical Institute of Heidelberg University, starting in the fall of
2021. The duration of the appointment is 2 years with a possible
extension for a third year if funding is available.

[https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/16551](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/16551)

The research station bundles fundamental research activities in geometry
and dynamical systems and promotes interaction of these fields with
other science, as well as with society. It provides a very active,
diverse and stimulating research environment. The postdoctoral
researcher will have access to funding for travel, conferences and
visitors. Faculty members involved in the research station are: Peter
Albers, Gabriele Benedetti, Beatrice Pozzetti, Jan Swoboda, and Anna
Wienhard. They are joined by a diverse and active group of postdocs and
PhD students.

Candidates should have excellent research potential with research
interests in geometry, topology, dynamics or group theory. Experience in
the study of geometric structures, representations varieties, Higgs
bundles or geometric group theory is a plus. Knowledge of the German
language is not required. Review of applications will begin in December
2020 and will continue until the position is filled.

Questions regarding the position can be addressed to Anna Wienhard or
any of the faculty members mentioned above by email:
GeoDyn@mathi.uni-heidelberg.de
