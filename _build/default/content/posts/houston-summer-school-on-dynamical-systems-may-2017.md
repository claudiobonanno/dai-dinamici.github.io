The Department of Mathematics at University of Houston will host the
fifth annual Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems from May 17-25,
2017.

As in past years, the school is designed for graduate students; however,
this year there will also be an opportunity for undergraduate students
to participate, arriving two days early and then staying for the main
event.

The following short courses are planned:

-   **Statistical properties in hyperbolic dynamics** (Vaughn
    Climenhaga, Will Ott, Andrew Török - University of Houston)
-   **Partially hyperbolic dynamics** (Todd Fisher - Brigham Young
    University)
-   **Dynamical methods in Diophantine approximation** (Alan Haynes -
    University of Houston)
-   **Dynamics of group actions on homogeneous spaces** (Anish Ghosh -
    Tata Institute of Fundamental Research)
-   **Linearly recurrent systems** (Valérie Berthé - Univ. Paris
    Diderot)
