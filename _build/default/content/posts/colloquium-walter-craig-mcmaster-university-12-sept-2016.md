Speaker: Prof. Walter Craig (McMaster University)

Title: Vortex Filament Dynamics

Abstract The evolution of vortex filaments in three dimensions is an
important problem in mathematical hydrodynamics. It appears in questions
on solutions of the Euler equations as well as in the fine structure
of vortex filamentation in a superfluid. It is also a setting in the
analysis of partial differential equations with a compelling analogy
to Hamiltonian dynamical systems. I will give an analysis of a system
of model equations for the dynamics of near-parallel vortex filaments in
the Euler flow of a three dimensional fluid.  These equations can be
formulated as a Hamiltonian system of partial differential equations. My
talk will describe some aspects of a phase space analysis of
solutions, including the construction of periodic and quasi-periodic
orbits via a version of KAM theory for PDEs, and a topological principle
to count multiplicity of solutions. This is ongoing joint work with L.
Corsi (Georgia Tech), C. Garcia (UNAM), C.-R. Yang (McMaster and Shantou
University).
