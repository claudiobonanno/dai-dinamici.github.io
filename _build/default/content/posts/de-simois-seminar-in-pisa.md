"AN INTEGRABLE BILLIARD CLOSE TO AN ELLIPSE OF SMALL ECCENTRICITY IS AN
ELLIPSE"

Abstract: In 1927 G. Birkhoff conjectured that if a billiard in a
strictly convex smooth domain is integrable, the domain has to be an
ellipse (or a circle). The conjecture is still wide open, and presents
remarkable relations with open questions in inverse spectral theory and
spectral rigidity. In the talk we show that a version of Birkhoff's
conjecture is true for small perturbations of ellipses of small
eccentricity. This is joint work with A. Avila and V. Kaloshin
