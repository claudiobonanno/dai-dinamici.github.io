Every year, ICTP's [Mathematics
section](https://www.ictp.it/research/math.aspx "MATH") offers research
opportunities for outstanding mathematicians from developing countries,
including postdoctorates. The section is now accepting applications for
its Postdoctoral Fellowships; the deadline is **7 January
2018**.

Postdoctoral Fellowships are intended for young mathematicians with a
strong research record. Fellows must have completed a PhD in mathematics
prior to the start of their fellowship. Women are particularly
encouraged to apply. The fellowships have a 12-month duration with a
possible extension for a further 12 months; the initial period will be
1
September 2018 - 31 August 2019. Candidates must apply
using the [online
application](https://e-applications.ictp.it/applicant/login/MP18).

Preference will be given to candidates who: 1) will benefit most from
the time spent at ICTP in pursuit of their own research, using the ICTP
facilities and participating in ICTP activities; and 2) will interact
with local scientists and visitors and will contribute to the
intellectual vitality of the Centre.

Candidates are required to arrange for the submission of three letters
of recommendation by established researchers. Incomplete applications
will not be considered. Successful candidates might be offered a
Shiing-Shen Chern Senior Post-Doctoral Fellowship.  The Fellowship,
named after Shiing-Chern, has especially attractive terms with a total
possible tenure of 3+2 years.

Postdoctoral fellows will have the opportunity to participate in an
array of mathematics activities at the network of scientific
institutions in Trieste: ICTP, the International School of Advanced
Studies (ISAS/SISSA) and the University of Trieste.
