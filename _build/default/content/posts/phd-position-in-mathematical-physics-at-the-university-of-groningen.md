#### PhD position in Mathematical Physics (218498)

The research group, *Dynamical Systems, Geometry and Mathematical
Physics,* is part of the *Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence* in the Faculty of Science and
Engineering of the university.

The research activities of the group cover a broad and diverse spectrum
of subjects in the fields of fundamental, applied and computational
dynamical systems theory, classical, statistical and quantum systems and
their interfaces in the light of dynamics, and theoretical and applied
aspects of geometry with many connections to dynamical systems theory.

The successful candidate will join a dynamic and well established
research group. The main topic of research will be the geometry and
spectral properties of quantum systems. The deep connection between the
geometry of classical Hamiltonian systems and their quantum mechanical
counterpart has been shown in multiple context, and resulted in
applications in many different fields of mathematics. During the course
of the PhD, the candidate will work on broadening this knowledge by
exploring new frontiers of the semi-classical theory of singular
systems. He or she will focus on the study and understanding of quantum
resonances in the semi-classical limits for Schrödinger operators with
long range perturbations and localized magnetic fields. Results in this
direction will open further direction of research both in semi-classical
mechanics and in spectral geometry.

**The University of Groningen offers, in accordance with the Collective
Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, a salary of € 2,266 gross per
month in the first year, up to a maximum of € 2,897 gross per month in
the fourth and final year, based on a full-time position (1.0 FTE),
excluding a holiday allowance of 8% gross annual income and a 8.3%
end-of-the-year allowance. The position is limited to a period of 4
years. A PhD training programme is part of the agreement and the
successful candidate will be enrolled in the Graduate School of Science
and Engineering.**

Applications received before 17 December 2018 will be given full
consideration; however, the position will remain open until it is
filled.
