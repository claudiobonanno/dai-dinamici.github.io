Dear collegues,

as many of you already know, the Hypatie Laboratory of Mathematical
Sciences (LYSM) is in full activity since one year and a half, and keeps
funding scientific collaborations between Italy and France, as well as
conferences with an Italian-French character.

The standard activities that we fund are short missions (one or two
weeks) or conferences (either participation or organization). For
details, please refer to the website https://www.lysm.eu/ For funding
applications, please use the web forms available on the website.

With this message, we would like to advertize a new opportunity, namely
the possibility of applying for funding of

EXTENDED MISSIONS

(more than 1 month, up to one academic year) from Italy to France, or
viceversa. The maximal funding per month offered by LYSM is in line with
the cost of life in these two countries: for details, please contact the
coordinators of the lab.

In order to apply, please use the \`Missions' form on the LYSM website.
The deadline for applications of proposals for the next academic year,
2018/19, is

SEPTEMBER 15, 2018

In your application, please explain in detail the scientific reasons of
your long-term missions, the research project that you intend to work on
and the expected output of the research, as well as the detailed
financial plan.

With best regards,

Viviane Baladi, Dario Bambusi,Cinzia Bisi, Benoit Claudon, Adriana
Garroni, Alessandro Giuliani, Daniele Guido, Massimiliano Mella, Thierry
Paul, Pierre Picco, Alessandra Sarti, Stephane Vassout
